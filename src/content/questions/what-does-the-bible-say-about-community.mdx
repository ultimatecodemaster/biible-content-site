Theological context reveals that the concept of community in the Bible is grounded in the Trinitarian nature of God, who exists in eternal relationship. Thus, believers are called not only to fellowship but to reflect God's love and unity through their interactions.

4. **Practice Virtues**: Strive to embody qualities like compassion, patience, and humility in your interactions, promoting a loving environment.
