## Understanding the Biblical Perspective

They collectively affirm that believers are called to live in relationship with one another, reflecting the relational nature of God Himself. Community is not merely a backdrop for individual faith; it is a vital context in which believers can flourish.

However, the New Testament consistently emphasizes interdependence and mutual support as fundamental to the Christian life. Understanding this biblical perspective helps believers recognize the value of coming together, sharing burdens, and encouraging one another in their walk with Christ.

The theological context of community is rooted in the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist in perfect relationship. As believers, we are invited into this divine fellowship and called to extend that relational dynamic to one another, fostering a community that mirrors God’s love and grace.
