The theological context suggests that true joy comes from recognizing God’s sovereignty and goodness, even when we face difficulties. Therefore, seeking joy in daily life is less about seeking happiness in worldly terms and more about aligning our hearts with God's purpose and presence.

4. **Fellowship with Others**: Surround yourself with joyful, uplifting people. Engage in community activities that encourage mutual support and celebration.
