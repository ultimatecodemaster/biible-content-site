Start by keeping a gratitude journal, where you regularly write down things you are thankful for. This simple exercise can shift your focus from what you lack to the abundance in your life. 

Additionally, make it a habit to express gratitude in your prayers. Acknowledge the blessings you receive daily, big or small, and thank God for His provisions. In social settings, share your gratitude with others, whether through a simple thank-you or by telling stories of God’s goodness in your life.
