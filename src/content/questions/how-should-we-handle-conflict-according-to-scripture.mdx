Together, these passages paint a comprehensive picture of conflict resolution in Scripture. They emphasize the importance of direct communication, self-control, and forgiveness while acknowledging that maintaining peace is a personal responsibility. A common misconception is that conflict should be avoided at all costs; however, Scripture demonstrates that conflict, when approached biblically, can lead to growth, understanding, and stronger relationships.

The theological context reveals that God's desire is for His people to live in harmony and love, reflecting His character. By adhering to these teachings, believers not only fulfill their spiritual obligations but also contribute to a more loving and unified community.

## Practical Application

To apply these biblical teachings in daily life, individuals can start by practicing active listening and open communication. This involves creating a safe space to discuss conflicts and being willing to hear the other person's perspective.

Forgiveness is another crucial step; it is important to remember that holding onto grudges can lead to bitterness. Instead, believers should strive to forgive as Christ forgave them, recognizing that this act is as much for their own healing as it is for the other person.
