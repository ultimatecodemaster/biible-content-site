Theological understanding reveals that God’s characteristics—His love, care, and sovereignty—are foundational to our ability to cope with stress. 

As we lean on these truths, we begin to see stress not merely as a burden but as an opportunity to deepen our relationship with God, who desires to carry our anxieties and grant us peace.

Surround yourself with a supportive community that can pray with and encourage you during stressful times, reinforcing the biblical principle that we are meant to bear one another’s burdens.
