As we pursue Him through prayer, worship, and community, we become more attuned to His voice and leading. This journey involves both humility and an openness to change, as God may lead us in unexpected directions.

Establish a routine that includes reading Scripture, journaling your thoughts and prayers, and reflecting on your desires in light of God's character. Engage in community with other believers who can offer support and counsel as you navigate your path.

Additionally, practice gratitude and rejoice in God’s goodness, even in uncertainty. This attitude fosters openness to His will and nourishes your spiritual growth.
