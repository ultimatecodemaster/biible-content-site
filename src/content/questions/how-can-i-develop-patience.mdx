It is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, emphasizing that developing patience is not solely about personal effort but about yielding to God's work within us.

However, biblical patience is an active process of enduring, growing, and seeking God’s strength in the midst of challenges. This understanding helps believers to see trials not as burdens but as opportunities for spiritual growth. 

The theological context reveals that patience is integral to the character of God Himself, who shows immense patience toward humanity. As believers grow in their understanding of God's patience, they are encouraged to reflect that same quality in their lives.
