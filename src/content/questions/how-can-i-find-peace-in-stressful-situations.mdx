Engage with Scripture daily, allowing God’s promises to remind you of His faithfulness. Consider practicing mindfulness through meditation or focusing on specific verses that speak of peace, such as Philippians 4:6-7.

Additionally, seek community support—connecting with fellow believers can provide encouragement and accountability. Finally, cultivate an attitude of gratitude, which can shift your focus from stressors to the blessings in your life.
