Additionally, some may wonder if their prayers are heard or answered; the passages above remind us of the relational aspect of prayer, with the Holy Spirit interceding for us and Jesus assuring us of the power of praying in His name.

The theological context of prayer reveals its function as an integral part of a believer’s life, reflecting our dependence on God and our desire for communion with Him. It connects us to the larger narrative of God’s love and grace throughout Scripture.
