The theological context of these teachings reveals that fear often arises from a lack of trust in God's sovereignty and goodness. The Bible encourages believers to lean into their faith, reminding us that God is a refuge and a source of strength. In doing so, we can confront our fears with the confidence that we are loved and supported by Almighty God.

## Practical Application

In addition, cultivate mindfulness by focusing on the present moment and practicing gratitude. This can help alleviate anxiety about the future. Incorporate Scripture memorization into your routine, specifically verses that remind you of God’s promises. By doing so, you arm yourself with truth when fear strikes.

Finally, seek out resources, such as counseling or support groups, if anxiety becomes overwhelming. Remember, it is okay to ask for help, and God's peace can work through various means to bring healing and comfort.
