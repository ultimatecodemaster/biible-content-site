3. **Use Scripture in Prayer**: Incorporate verses from the Bible into your prayers. This can enhance your communication with God and deepen your understanding of His Word.

4. **Join a Prayer Group**: Engage with others in prayer, whether it's a small group or a church community. Shared prayers can build community and encourage mutual support.
