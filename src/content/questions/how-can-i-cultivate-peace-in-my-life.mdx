However, the biblical narrative consistently points to the necessity of a heart aligned with God. This means recognizing that true peace flows from understanding His character, His promises, and the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ. 

The theological context reveals that peace is both a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22) and a byproduct of a life surrendered to Christ. As we grow in faith and deepen our understanding of God's Word, we become more adept at experiencing and extending His peace in our lives.
